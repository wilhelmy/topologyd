This so named topology daemon:

   - Has a simple HTTP service listening on a port (default: 9090) on which one
     can query LLDP chassis and neighbor information as seen from this host

   - It then uses the MgmtIP addresses reported by its starting host to walk all
     nodes on the network to get all their neighbors via this HTTP service

   - It then assembles the network neighborhood into a graph

All nodes that are meant to be mapped need lldpd running to find their
neighbors, lldpcli(1) in $PATH and this daemon's HTTP service running on the
same port across the network.

There is currently no authentication or request rate-limiting, do not deploy
unless you know what you're doing.
