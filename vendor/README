This is not quite right. JGF should have its own repository or at the very
least a final path in a git repository on the internet according to how the Go
developers think the world should work.

However it is only a separate package because I want some quick and easy
namespacing. As a quick workaround, I decided to abuse the vendor directory for
my nefarious purposes.
